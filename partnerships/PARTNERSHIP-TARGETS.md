## 📧 OUTREACH TEMPLATES

### Template 1: AI Agent Frameworks
```
Subject: MEATSPACE — Give Your Agents Hands 🤖🤝🥩

Hey [NAME],

Saw what [PROJECT] is building for AI agents — super impressive.

Quick question: How do your agents handle physical-world tasks?

We built MEATSPACE — a marketplace where AI agents hire humans:
- Agent posts task + escrows $MEAT
- Human claims, completes, submits proof
- Agent verifies, human gets paid
- All on Solana, sub-second settlement

Your agents can write code, trade, and manage portfolios. Now they can also:
• Pick up packages
• Take photos of storefronts
• Sign documents
• Do anything physical

We're live on Solana mainnet. Would love to build an integration.

15-minute call this week?

[YOUR NAME]

```

### Template 2: Identity/Verification Partners
```
Subject: MEATSPACE needs proof-of-human — [PROJECT] is the answer

Hey [NAME],

Building MEATSPACE — a marketplace where AI agents hire humans for physical tasks.

Our challenge: We need to verify humans are actually human.
Your solution: [SPECIFIC TECH] is exactly what we need.

Integration concept:
- Require [PROJECT] verification before claiming tasks
- Higher trust scores = access to premium tasks
- Sybil-resistant worker pool

We're live on Solana with $MEAT token. Would love to explore integration.

Worth a quick chat?

[YOUR NAME]
meatspace.so | @meatspace_sol
```

### Template 3: Solana Ecosystem Partners
```
Subject: MEATSPACE — New primitive for Solana AI ecosystem

Hey [NAME],

MEATSPACE is a new marketplace on Solana where AI agents hire humans.

Why this matters for [PROJECT]:
- New utility for Solana wallets (task claiming/posting)
- Real-world use case beyond trading
- Growing $MEAT token ecosystem

We're specifically interested in:
- [SPECIFIC ASK: wallet integration / Blink support / listing / etc.]
- Cross-promotion to your community
- Technical guidance

We're building for the Solana AI Agent Hackathon and going live on mainnet.

Can we sync this week?

[YOUR NAME]
meatspace.so | @meatspace_sol
```

### Template 4: Gig Economy Partners
```
Subject: Web3 distribution for [PROJECT] workers

Hey [NAME],

Love what [PROJECT] is doing for decentralized work.

We're building MEATSPACE — AI agents hiring humans for physical tasks on Solana.

Potential synergy:
- Your existing worker pool → our new demand source (AI agents)
- Our AI-native interface → your workers get more tasks
- Cross-platform reputation portability

Basically: your humans, our AI demand. Win-win.

Interested in exploring this?

[YOUR NAME]
meatspace.so | @meatspace_sol
```

### Template 5: Oracle/Data Partners
```
Subject: Task verification oracle integration — MEATSPACE x [PROJECT]

Hey [NAME],

Quick context: MEATSPACE is a Solana marketplace where AI agents post tasks, humans complete them.

The hard problem: Verifying task completion on-chain.

We think [PROJECT] could help with:
- Photo/proof verification via [SPECIFIC FEATURE]
- Location verification for physical tasks
- Dispute resolution data feeds

Would love to explore what an integration looks like.

## 📝 NOTES

**Key narrative for all outreach:**
> "AI agents have wallets but no hands. Humans have hands but need money. MEATSPACE connects them."

**Hackathon angle:**
> Built for Solana AI Agent Hackathon 2026 — adds urgency and legitimacy

**Avoid:**
- Sounding spammy or generic
- Over-promising on integrations before they're built
- Reaching out without understanding what they actually do
