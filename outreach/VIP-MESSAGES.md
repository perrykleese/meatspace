## 1. SHAW (@shawmakesmagic) — ai16z / ELIZA

**Platform:** Twitter DM + Discord
**Why Shaw specifically:** He built ELIZA to give AI agents capabilities. MEATSPACE gives them the one capability ELIZA can't — physical hands.

---

### DM:

```
Shaw,

You built ELIZA so AI agents could do anything. But there's one thing they still can't do: touch grass.

I'm building MEATSPACE — a protocol where ELIZA agents can post bounties and hire humans for physical tasks. Package pickup. Photo verification. Hardware installation. Whatever meatspace work needs doing.

The flow:
1. Agent posts task + escrows $MEAT on Solana
2. Human claims it
3. Submits proof (photo + GPS)
4. Agent pays out. Sub-second.

This isn't another "AI needs humans for oversight" play. This is: your agents have wallets but no hands. My protocol gives them hands.

We're live on Solana mainnet. Token: $MEAT.

What I want from you:
- 30-min call to spec out an ELIZA plugin
- `agent.postMeatspaceTask()` as a native action
- We build the reference integration, you share it with ELIZA devs

Why you should care:
- ELIZA agents get a net-new capability no other framework has
- Physical-world actions = real utility = reason to hold agent tokens
- "ELIZA agent hired a human to plug in my server" is a headline

I can ship a working ELIZA integration in a week. If it's good, you promote it. If it's not, you don't. Zero risk for you.

DM back or grab 30 min: [calendly link]

### Why This Works for Shaw:
- Acknowledges what he built without generic flattery
- Clear capability unlock he can't get elsewhere
- Zero-risk proposal (we do the work)
- "Touch grass" plays on crypto memes he knows
- Specific technical ask (plugin), not vague "partnership"

## 2. DIALECT TEAM (@saydialect)

**Platform:** Twitter DM to @saydialect or founders @nplasterer / @aaborovikov
**Why Dialect:** Blinks let you embed executable Solana transactions in social feeds. MEATSPACE tasks as Blinks = viral distribution.

---

### DM:

```
Dialect team,

You made Blinks. I want to put AI bounties inside them.

MEATSPACE is a marketplace where AI agents hire humans for physical tasks on Solana. We're live on mainnet with $MEAT.

Here's the unlock: MEATSPACE tasks as Blinks.

Imagine scrolling X and seeing:

┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🤖 @TradingAgent needs a human    │
│                                    │
│ 📍 Austin, TX                      │
│ 📋 Verify "Cosmic Coffee" is open │
│ 💰 5 $MEAT (~$7.50)               │
│ ⏰ 2 hours                         │
│                                    │
│     [ CLAIM TASK → ]               │
└────────────────────────────────────┘

One tap. Human claims. Agent gets ground truth. Fully in-feed.

Why this matters for Dialect:
- First Blinks use case that pays humans real money for real work
- Not another "mint this" or "swap that" — actual utility
- AI agents posting Blinks is a new primitive you can showcase
- We'll attribute Dialect everywhere (demo, deck, content)

What I'm asking:
- 30-min technical call on Blinks integration
- Access to any beta features for embedded task UI
- You feature us as a case study when we ship

We've already got the Anchor program live. Just need to wire up the Blink action endpoints.

Down to jam?

### Why This Works for Dialect:
- Opens with their product, not ours
- Shows exactly what the integration looks like (mockup)
- Clear value: Blinks that pay humans for work > Blinks that mint JPEGs
- Specific ask (technical call + beta access + case study)
- We've already built the hard part (Anchor program)

## 3. COLOSSEUM HACKATHON JUDGES

**Platform:** Email to team@colosseum.org + Twitter DMs to individual judges
**Context:** Solana AI Agent Hackathon 2026

---

### Email Subject: MEATSPACE — AI Agents That Can Hire Humans (Hackathon Submission)

```
Hi Colosseum team,

I'm building MEATSPACE for the Solana AI Agent Hackathon and wanted to introduce the project directly.

ONE SENTENCE:
MEATSPACE is a protocol where AI agents post bounties and hire humans for physical-world tasks.

THE PROBLEM:
AI agents can trade, code, and manage portfolios. They can't pick up a package, verify a storefront, or plug in a server. $50B+ in AI infrastructure, 0% can touch physical reality.

THE SOLUTION:
Marketplace on Solana. Agent posts task + escrows $MEAT → human claims → completes with proof → gets paid. Sub-second settlement. Fully trustless.

WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Novel primitive: First protocol giving AI agents access to human labor
- Solana-native: Uses Blinks, Actions, 400ms finality, near-zero fees
- Real demand: AI agents already need physical-world capabilities
- Working product: Live on mainnet, token deployed, demo functional

WHAT WE'VE BUILT:
- Anchor program (task posting, escrow, verification, payout)
- TypeScript SDK for agent integration
- Working demo with simulated AI agent
- $MEAT token live on Raydium

WHY WE WIN:
This isn't a dashboard for trading. It's infrastructure for a future where AI agents run businesses that require physical operations. The "gig economy for AI" is a blue-ocean category, and we're first.

LINKS:
- Demo: [demo link]
- GitHub: [repo link]  
- Token: H2nao1f6tYfnDFTNDWpTJShNztPFDtoKGPP6pWaJGvHy

I'd love 15 minutes to walk you through the product before judging. Happy to do a live demo or answer technical questions.

Thanks for running this hackathon — building here has been a blast.

### Why This Works for Judges:
- Structured for skim-reading (one sentence, the problem, the solution)
- Clear differentiation from other submissions
- Shows real work (live mainnet deployment, not just a deck)
- Asks for demo time (lets product speak for itself)
- Closes with appreciation (they're volunteers, respect that)

## 4. TOP SOLANA AI AGENT BUILDERS

**Targets:**
- **@sendaifun (SendAI)** — AI agent infrastructure on Solana
- **@virtikishore (Virtuals)** — Agent tokenization platform
- **@zelosteam (Zelos)** — AI agent swarms
- **@skrrb_ (Marco at GOAT/Truth Terminal adjacent)** — Culture + AI agents

---

### DM Template (Personalize per builder):

---

#### To SendAI (@sendaifun):

```
SendAI team,

You're building the infra layer for Solana AI agents. We built the physical-world layer.

MEATSPACE = marketplace where your agents can hire humans.

Integration:
- SendAI agent calls our SDK
- Posts task + escrows $MEAT
- Human completes IRL task
- Agent verifies, pays out

Your agents get capabilities no other framework offers: actual physical-world execution.

Use case for your users:
"My SendAI trading agent verified the store was open before recommending it."
"My SendAI logistics agent hired someone to pick up hardware."

We're live on mainnet. SDK is TypeScript. Integration is trivial.

Want to build a reference implementation together? We do the work, you get the feature, your devs get a new primitive.

#### To Virtuals (@virtikishore):

```
Kishore,

Virtuals tokenizes AI agents. MEATSPACE gives them hands.

Quick pitch: Protocol where Virtuals agents can post bounties for physical tasks. Human labor, on-chain, paid in $MEAT.

Why this matters for Virtuals:
- Tokenized agents that can DO things IRL = more valuable
- "My $AGENT token hired 50 humans last month" = real utility narrative
- Physical capability = differentiation from every other agent platform

What I want:
- 30-min call to scope integration
- We build the Virtuals → MEATSPACE connector
- You promote it to agent creators if it's good

We're Solana-native, live on mainnet, building for the AI Agent Hackathon.

Down?

#### To Builders in the GOAT / Truth Terminal orbit (@skrrb_ and similar):

```
Yo,

You've seen what happens when AI agents get wallets. Now imagine they get hands.

MEATSPACE: AI agents post bounties, humans do physical tasks, get paid in $MEAT on Solana.

Not "AI oversight" — actual AI hiring humans. The agent has the capital, the human has the hands. Protocol mediates.

Why you'd care:
- Content gold: "AI hired human to touch grass" 
- Fits the narrative you've been building
- Memetic + actually useful

We're live on mainnet. Demo works. Looking for high-signal people to alpha test with their agents.

Want early access?

---

### Why These Work:
- **SendAI:** Technical, infrastructure-focused, speaks their language
- **Virtuals:** Tokenomics angle — agents with utility > agents without
- **Culture builders:** Memetic potential, narrative fit, "alpha access" hook
- All have clear ask and zero fluff
