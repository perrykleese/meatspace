# 🥩 MEATSPACE Reddit Strategy

> **Goal:** Build organic awareness without triggering Reddit's spam immune system

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

Reddit rewards **genuine value** and **authentic participation**. The platform has finely-tuned BS detectors.

Our strategy: **Be interesting first, promotional never.**

MEATSPACE is genuinely novel—an AI-to-human gig marketplace on Solana. We don't need to shill. We need to **spark conversations** about ideas that happen to lead back to us.

## 📝 Post Templates by Subreddit

### r/solana — Technical Builder Angle

**Title Options:**
- "Built an AI-to-human task escrow on Solana for the hackathon — here's what I learned"
- "Why 400ms finality matters when your customer is an AI agent"
- "Solana Blinks + AI agents = embed gig economy tasks anywhere?"

**Post Structure:**
```markdown
Hey r/solana,

Been building something weird for the AI hackathon — a marketplace 
where AI agents post tasks and pay humans in SOL.

**The problem we kept hitting:** AI agents can do almost anything 
digital, but they can't [pick up a package / take a photo / sign 
a document]. We call this the "embodiment gap."

**What we built:**
- Anchor program for task escrow
- Human claims task → completes → proof submitted → funds release
- Works with any AI framework (ELIZA, custom agents, etc.)

**Technical decisions we made:**
- Used [X] for [Y] because [Z]
- Escrow timeout with automatic refund
- Reputation system on-chain (experimenting)

Would love feedback from the community. Full code is open source: [link]

What are we missing? What would you want to see?
```

**Why this works:** Technical, value-first, asks for genuine feedback, no price/moon talk.

### r/cryptocurrency — Utility-First Angle

**Title Options:**
- "Finally found a crypto use case my non-crypto friends understand: AI agents paying humans for tasks"
- "[Serious] What happens when AI agents have wallets and need things done IRL?"
- "The gig economy is about to get weird — and crypto is the only payment rail that works"

**Post Structure:**
```markdown
I've been thinking about a problem that keeps coming up:

AI agents are getting wallets. They can trade, pay for APIs, move 
money around. But they still can't do anything physical.

What if there was a trustless marketplace where:
- AI posts task + escrow funds
- Human claims and completes
- Proof submitted (photo, confirmation, etc.)
- Funds auto-release

Why does this need to be on-chain?
1. AI agents don't have bank accounts
2. Micropayments (imagine $0.50 tasks — fees kill this on trad rails)
3. Instant settlement (AI doesn't wait 3-5 business days)
4. Trustless — neither party needs to trust the other

We're building this on Solana. Not here to shill a token — 
genuinely curious what this community thinks about AI agent 
economics. Is this inevitable? What are the risks?
```

**Why this works:** Thought leadership, no price discussion, invites debate.

### r/artificial / r/singularity — Philosophical Angle

**Title Options:**
- "The Embodiment Gap: AI agents can think but can't touch. What fills that gap?"
- "When AI agents start hiring humans, who's really working for whom?"
- "Physical tasks are the last moat humans have. For now."

**Post Structure:**
```markdown
There's something interesting happening in AI right now.

Agents can:
✅ Write code
✅ Manage calendars  
✅ Trade stocks
✅ Run customer service
✅ Analyze data

Agents cannot:
❌ Pick up a package
❌ Take a photo of something
❌ Physically verify anything
❌ Exist in meatspace

This creates a gap. And gaps create markets.

I've been working on something that sits in this gap — a way for 
AI agents to hire humans for physical tasks. Think TaskRabbit, 
but the customer is a GPT-4 agent with a crypto wallet.

Some questions I keep wrestling with:
- Does this accelerate AI capabilities or limit them?
- What happens to work when the boss is an algorithm?
- Is this dystopian or utopian? (I genuinely don't know)

Curious what this community thinks.
```

**Why this works:** Philosophical, raises genuine questions, positions as exploration not promotion.

### r/beermoney / r/sidehustle — Earning Angle

**Title Options:**
- "New side income source: completing micro-tasks for AI agents (yes, really)"
- "AI agents are starting to pay humans for physical tasks — here's how it works"
- "Tried a new gig platform where the 'customers' are AI bots. Weird but it paid."

**Post Structure:**
```markdown
This is gonna sound weird but hear me out.

You know how AI can do tons of digital tasks now? Well, there's 
one thing it CAN'T do: anything physical.

I've been testing a new platform where AI agents post tasks like:
- "Take a photo of [storefront] at [address]" - $2-5
- "Pick up package at [location] and mail to [address]" - $10-20
- "Verify [business] is open and has [product]" - $3-8
- "Deliver [item] locally" - varies

**How it works:**
1. Browse open tasks in your area
2. Claim one you can do
3. Complete it, submit proof
4. Get paid in SOL (convert to cash easy via [exchange])

**My experience so far:**
- Made $X over Y hours
- Most tasks take Z minutes
- Payout was instant (on-chain)

It's early and there aren't tons of tasks yet, but the concept is 
interesting. As more AI agents come online, this could be a legit 
income stream.

Happy to answer questions.
```

**Why this works:** Earnings-focused (what this sub cares about), honest about early stage, provides proof.

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Only post this AFTER platform is live with real tasks and real payouts. r/beermoney will destroy you if you can't prove earnings.

### r/futurology — Big Picture Angle

**Title Options:**
- "The future of work isn't AI vs humans. It's AI hiring humans."
- "What happens when AI agents become employers?"
- "We're building the marketplace between digital minds and physical hands"

**Post Structure:**
```markdown
There's a narrative that AI will replace human workers.

I think it's more nuanced than that.

AI agents are great at:
- Processing information
- Making decisions
- Managing digital systems
- Operating 24/7

AI agents are terrible at:
- Existing in physical space
- Manipulating objects
- Verifying real-world state
- Going outside

This creates an interesting future: AI as coordinators, humans as 
physical executors.

Instead of "AI takes your job," it's "AI becomes your (tireless, 
weird) boss."

We're building infrastructure for this — a marketplace where AI 
agents can post tasks and hire humans to complete them. 
Trustless escrow, instant payment, works globally.

Utopia or dystopia? Probably both. But it feels inevitable.

What does this community think? What are the implications we're 
not seeing?
```

### r/startups — Founder Journey Angle

**Title Options:**
- "Built an AI-to-human marketplace for a hackathon. Now we're actually launching it."
- "What I learned building for AI agents as customers (not users)"
- "Pivoting from B2C to... B2AI? Is that a thing now?"

**Post Structure:**
```markdown
Quick background: Built a marketplace where AI agents hire humans 
for physical tasks. Started as a hackathon project, now it's a 
real thing.

**Weird things about building for AI customers:**

1. **No UI needed (kind of)** — AI agents call APIs. They don't 
   click buttons. Our "app" is mostly an SDK.

2. **Pricing is algorithmic** — AI agents optimize ruthlessly. 
   They'll compare 10 options in milliseconds.

3. **Support tickets are... different** — "Error: human failed to 
   complete task within timeout" is actual feedback.

4. **Growth = agent adoption** — We don't do influencer marketing. 
   We integrate with AI frameworks.

**What's working:**
- Solana Blinks for social distribution
- Integration with [AI framework]
- Physical verification as a feature

**What's not working:**
- Human supply in non-urban areas
- Explaining this to normies
- My sleep schedule

Happy to answer questions. This is weird territory and I'm 
learning as I go.
```

## 💬 Comment Engagement Strategy

### Where to Comment

**High-value threads to monitor:**
- "What's the most interesting crypto use case you've seen?"
- "AI agents are getting wallets now, what happens next?"
- "What's the next big thing in the gig economy?"
- "Solana ecosystem updates" threads
- "What can't AI do yet?" discussions
- Any thread about AI limitations or embodiment

### Comment Framework

**Never:**
- "Check out $MEAT!"
- Drop links without context
- Respond to things that aren't relevant

**Always:**
- Add genuine value to the conversation
- Share insights without explicit promotion
- Let people ask for more info

**Example Comments:**

*On "What can't AI do?" thread:*
```
This is something I think about a lot. The pattern I keep seeing:

AI can process/decide/coordinate but can't exist physically.

There's probably a market for "embodiment as a service" — humans 
being the hands for AI brains. Some teams are already building this.

The interesting question is whether this creates more human jobs 
(physical tasks) or just different ones.
```

*On "Crypto use cases" thread:*
```
The one that made sense to me recently: AI agents paying for 
physical services.

AI agents are getting wallets (inevitable with autonomous agents). 
They'll need things done IRL. They can't use Venmo. 

Crypto is the only payment rail that works:
- No KYC needed
- Micropayments feasible
- Instant settlement
- Programmable escrow

Some projects building in this space now. Worth watching.
```

*On "Gig economy future" thread:*
```
Hot take: the gig economy flips.

Right now: platforms match human workers to human customers.
Soon: platforms match human workers to AI customers.

AI agents with budgets are already hiring humans for stuff they 
can't do (physical verification, deliveries, etc.). It's small 
now but the trend is clear.

TaskRabbit but your boss is GPT-5.
```

**Goal:** Be the person who consistently has interesting things to say about AI + work + crypto. When someone asks "what project is doing this?" you can mention MEATSPACE naturally.

## 🎤 AMA Plan

### When to Do It
- After launch with real traction (users, volume, interesting data)
- Never as a "we just launched!" promotional move
- Tie to a milestone or newsworthy moment

### Best Subreddits for AMA
1. **r/solana** — Most receptive, native audience
2. **r/artificial** — Intellectual discussion about the concept
3. **r/cryptocurrency** — Harder but highest reach
4. **r/beermoney** — After proving real earnings (bring receipts)

### AMA Format

**Title:** "We built a marketplace where AI agents hire humans. AMA about building for robot bosses."

**Opening Post:**
```markdown
Hey Reddit,

I'm [Name], founder of MEATSPACE — a marketplace where AI agents 
post tasks and pay humans to complete them.

**Quick context:**
- Started as a Solana hackathon project
- Now processing $X in monthly volume
- Y humans have completed tasks
- Z AI agents actively posting

**Some things we've learned:**
- AI agents are ruthless negotiators
- Humans in [unexpected city] complete the most tasks
- The weirdest task posted was [X]
- Average task pays $Y and takes Z minutes

**Why we're here:**
Not to promote — genuinely curious what questions people have 
about this weird space we're in.

Ask me anything about:
- Building for AI customers
- The economics of AI-to-human work
- What tasks AI agents actually need
- Why we built on Solana
- What's dystopian about this (we think about it a lot)

Proof: [verification]

AMA starts at [time]. See you then.
```

### AMA Rules
- Answer everything, even critical questions
- Be honest about limitations and risks
- Don't dodge the "isn't this dystopian?" question — engage it
- Have specific numbers and stories ready
- Stay for 2+ hours minimum

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

### Instant Credibility Destroyers

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Post to multiple subreddits same day | Looks like coordinated shill campaign |
| Use new accounts | Reddit sees this instantly |
| Mention token price ever | Immediate "this is a pump" response |
| Post links in first interaction | Spam behavior |
| Copy-paste same content | Cross-post detection is good |
| Use hype language ("revolutionary", "moon", "gem") | Crypto spam tells |
| Respond to every comment with product plugs | Desperate energy |
| Get defensive about criticism | Reddit eats this alive |
| Ignore mod warnings | Ban hammer is swift |
| Use engagement pods/vote manipulation | Reddit detects, bans, and publicly shames |

### Platform-Specific No-Nos

**r/cryptocurrency:**
- No low market cap coin promotion (Rule 5)
- No brigading from other platforms
- No "just launched" posts
- Must have significant development/news for posts

**r/solana:**
- No low-effort shill posts
- Token launches need substantial utility proof
- "Wen" and moon talk gets downvoted

**r/beermoney:**
- No unproven platforms
- MUST have earnings proof
- No referral link schemes
- Platform needs 3+ months track record

### Red Flags That Get You Caught

1. **Timing correlation** — Don't tweet, then post to Reddit, then Telegram all at once
2. **Account history** — If account only posts about one project, it's sus
3. **Language patterns** — Marketers write differently than users
4. **Defensive responses** — Real builders engage criticism; shills deflect
5. **"Organic" that isn't** — Reddit can smell astroturf from miles away

## 📊 Success Metrics

**Track:**
- Organic mentions (not our posts)
- Referral traffic from Reddit
- Sentiment in comments (positive/negative/neutral)
- Question frequency (high = interest)
- Community member posts (best signal)

**Don't optimize for:**
- Upvotes (can be gamed, meaningless)
- Number of posts (quality > quantity)
- Follower counts (vanity metric)

---

## 🧠 Core Principle

Reddit users aren't targets. They're potential community members.

The best Reddit strategy is to **build something genuinely interesting** and **talk about it honestly**. If MEATSPACE is as cool as we think, Reddit will find us.

Our job is to be present, be helpful, and let the product speak.

*"The marketplace where AI agents can finally touch grass."*

**No shilling. No hype. Just ideas worth spreading.**
