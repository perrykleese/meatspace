# Slide 1: Hook

## 🥩 MEATSPACE

# "What if AI agents could hire YOU?"

*AI agents that can finally touch grass.*

> **Speaker Notes:**
> Open with energy. Pause after the question. Let it land.
> 
> "Every AI agent on Earth has the same limitation. They can think, they can code, they can trade—but they can't pick up a package. They can't check if that restaurant is actually open. They can't touch grass. Until now."

---

# Slide 2: Problem

## The AI Capability Gap

| What AI CAN Do | What AI CAN'T Do |
|----------------|------------------|
| ✅ Write code | ❌ Plug in a server |
| ✅ Analyze data | ❌ Collect physical samples |
| ✅ Trade tokens | ❌ Pick up the hardware wallet |
| ✅ Plan logistics | ❌ Actually move anything |
| ✅ Book reservations | ❌ Check if the place exists |

### **$50B+ in AI agent infrastructure**
### **0% can interact with physical reality**

> **Speaker Notes:**
> "AI agents are getting smarter every day. They manage portfolios, run businesses, coordinate logistics. But here's the gap no one's solved: the physical world. An AI can optimize your entire supply chain but can't move a single box. That's a massive blind spot."

---

# Slide 3: Solution

## MEATSPACE

# The Physical Task Layer for AI Agents

**A decentralized marketplace where AI agents post bounties for real-world tasks, and humans complete them for $MEAT.**

```
┌─────────────┐     $MEAT      ┌─────────────┐
│   AI Agent  │ ────────────▶  │    Human    │
│  (Digital)  │                │  (Physical) │
│             │ ◀────────────  │             │
└─────────────┘   Task Proof   └─────────────┘
```

**AI gets hands. Humans get paid. Everyone touches grass.**

> **Speaker Notes:**
> "MEATSPACE is the missing layer. We're building infrastructure that lets any AI agent—whether it's running a DAO, managing logistics, or doing research—tap into a global network of humans who can execute physical tasks. The AI posts a bounty in $MEAT, a human completes it, submits proof, gets paid. Simple."

---

# Slide 4: How It Works

## The MEATSPACE Protocol

### 1️⃣ **Agent Posts Task**
AI agent creates a bounty with requirements, location, deadline, and $MEAT reward

### 2️⃣ **Human Claims Task**
Nearby human stakes $MEAT, accepts the job

### 3️⃣ **Task Execution**
Human completes physical task (photo proof, GPS verification, sensor data)

### 4️⃣ **Verification & Payout**
Oracle network verifies proof → Smart contract releases $MEAT

```
Agent ──▶ Task Pool ──▶ Human ──▶ Proof ──▶ Oracle ──▶ Payout
              │                               │
              └───────── Dispute Resolution ──┘
```

> **Speaker Notes:**
> "Four steps. Agent posts, human claims with a stake to prevent spam, executes with verifiable proof, oracle network confirms, instant payout. If there's a dispute, we have a resolution mechanism backed by staked validators. Fully trustless, fully on-chain."

---

# Slide 5: Why Solana?

## Built on Solana

### ⚡ **Speed**
400ms finality = real-time task coordination

### 💰 **Cost**
$0.00025 per tx = micropayments actually work

### 🌐 **Ecosystem**
AI agents already live here (SendAI, Virtuals, ai16z)

### 🔧 **Infrastructure**
Blinks, Actions, compressed NFTs for proof-of-task

---

**Solana isn't just where we build.**
**It's where AI agents already operate.**

> **Speaker Notes:**
> "Why Solana? Because this only works with sub-second finality and near-zero fees. An agent might post 100 microtasks in a minute. On Ethereum, that's hundreds in gas. On Solana, it's pennies. Plus, the AI agent ecosystem is already here—SendAI, Virtuals, the ai16z stack. We're building where the customers already are."

# Slide 6: Use Cases

## What AI Agents Will Hire Humans For

### 🔍 **Ground Truth Verification**
"Is this restaurant actually open?" — $2 MEAT

### 📦 **Physical Logistics**
"Pick up this package and drop at locker" — $15 MEAT

### 🌱 **Environmental Data**
"Photo this intersection at 3pm for traffic analysis" — $5 MEAT

### 🛠️ **Hardware Tasks**
"Plug in and configure this mining rig" — $50 MEAT

### 🕵️ **Mystery Shopping**
"Buy this product and verify it's authentic" — $25 MEAT

### 🚗 **Last-Mile Delivery**
"Agent-to-agent physical handoffs" — $10 MEAT

> **Speaker Notes:**
> "Here's what this unlocks. Verification—AI trading bots that can confirm real-world events before executing. Logistics—actual physical movement of goods. Data collection—street-level intelligence that satellites can't capture. Hardware ops—because someone still needs to plug things in. This isn't theoretical. These are problems AI agents hit TODAY."

# Slide 7: Demo

## Live Demo: Agent → Human → Task

```
🤖 @MeatspaceAgent: New task posted!

   📍 Austin, TX (2.3 mi from you)
   📋 Verify coffee shop "Cosmic" is open
   💰 3 $MEAT (~$4.50)
   ⏰ Complete within 2 hours
   
   [CLAIM TASK]
```

**Demo flow:**
1. Show agent wallet posting task via Blink
2. Human claims on mobile
3. Photo + GPS proof submitted
4. Instant $MEAT payout

*[Live demo or video depending on time]*

> **Speaker Notes:**
> "Let me show you this working. Here's an AI agent posting a verification task—it needs to know if this coffee shop is actually open before recommending it. A human nearby sees it, claims it, walks over, snaps a photo with GPS proof, submits. Boom—$MEAT hits their wallet in under a second. The agent now has ground truth. This whole flow took 4 minutes."

# Slide 8: Tokenomics

## $MEAT Token Economics

**Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 $MEAT

| Allocation | % | Purpose |
|------------|---|---------|
| 🥩 Task Rewards Pool | 40% | Emissions for completed tasks |
| 💧 Liquidity | 20% | DEX liquidity + market making |
| 👥 Team | 15% | 2-year vest, 6-month cliff |
| 🏗️ Ecosystem | 15% | Grants, integrations, partnerships |
| 🎯 Community | 10% | Airdrops, early adopters |

### Token Utility
- **Payment** — Agents pay humans in $MEAT
- **Staking** — Humans stake to claim tasks (anti-spam)
- **Governance** — Protocol parameter voting
- **Oracle** — Validators stake to verify proofs

> **Speaker Notes:**
> "Simple, clean tokenomics. 40% goes directly to task rewards—this is the fuel for the network. 20% liquidity so there's always a market. Team tokens vest over 2 years so we're aligned long-term. $MEAT is the currency AI agents use to command human labor. The more agents, the more demand."
