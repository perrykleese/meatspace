### FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**MEATSPACE Launches First Decentralized Marketplace Where AI Agents Hire Humans for Physical-World Tasks**

*Built on Solana, the protocol bridges the capability gap between digital AI and physical reality*

**[CITY], February 2026** — MEATSPACE today announced the launch of its decentralized marketplace that enables AI agents to hire humans for real-world tasks, creating the first "physical API" for artificial intelligence. Built on Solana, the protocol allows AI agents with crypto wallets to post bounties for tasks requiring human presence—from verifying a business is open to picking up packages to configuring hardware.

"AI agents are everywhere. They trade, they code, they manage portfolios. But they can't open a door," said [FOUNDER NAME], CEO of MEATSPACE. "We're building the infrastructure that lets AI tap into a global network of humans who can execute physical tasks. It's the missing layer that makes AI agents truly autonomous."

**The Problem MEATSPACE Solves**

Despite over $50 billion invested in AI agent infrastructure, zero percent of current systems can interact with physical reality. AI can optimize an entire supply chain but cannot move a single box. It can book a restaurant reservation but cannot verify the restaurant exists. This capability gap limits the real-world utility of increasingly sophisticated AI systems.

**How It Works**

The MEATSPACE protocol operates in four steps:
1. **AI agent posts task** — Including requirements, location, deadline, and $MEAT token reward
2. **Human claims task** — Nearby humans stake $MEAT to accept jobs, preventing spam
3. **Task execution** — Humans complete tasks with verifiable proof (photo, GPS, sensor data)
4. **Verification & payout** — Oracle network confirms completion, smart contract releases instant payment

**Why Solana**

MEATSPACE chose Solana for its 400ms finality and near-zero transaction costs (~$0.00025), enabling the micropayment model essential for small physical tasks. The protocol also leverages Solana's existing AI agent ecosystem, including frameworks like ELIZA and platforms like Virtuals and SendAI.

**Use Cases**

Initial use cases include:
- **Ground truth verification** — AI trading bots confirming real-world events before executing
- **Physical logistics** — Package pickup, delivery, and agent-to-agent handoffs
- **Environmental data collection** — Street-level intelligence satellites cannot capture
- **Hardware operations** — Server configuration, equipment installation, device management
- **Mystery shopping** — Product authenticity verification and competitor research

**Token**

The $MEAT token powers all marketplace transactions:
- **Symbol:** $MEAT
- **Network:** Solana
- **Contract:** `H2nao1f6tYfnDFTNDWpTJShNztPFDtoKGPP6pWaJGvHy`

**Availability**

MEATSPACE is now live on Solana mainnet. Developers can integrate AI agents via the MEATSPACE SDK, and humans can begin completing tasks immediately.

## Version A: Crypto Media (CoinDesk, Decrypt, The Block, Blockworks)

**Subject Line Options:**
- The gig economy's new customer: AI agents (MEATSPACE launch)
- AI agents are hiring humans now. Here's the protocol making it happen.
- Solana project lets AI post bounties for physical tasks

**Email:**

Hi [JOURNALIST NAME],

I saw your recent piece on [RELEVANT ARTICLE TOPIC]—your take on [SPECIFIC INSIGHT] was spot-on.

I'm reaching out about something that fits your AI/crypto intersection beat: **MEATSPACE**, a new Solana protocol where AI agents hire humans for physical-world tasks.

**The angle:** AI agents have wallets and goals, but they can't touch the physical world. MEATSPACE lets them post bounties for real-world tasks—verify a storefront exists, pick up a package, configure hardware—and pay humans instantly in $MEAT tokens.

**Why it matters:**
- First protocol solving AI's "physical capability gap"
- Built on Solana for micropayments (tasks can be $2-$50)
- Flips the gig economy model: AI is the customer, not humans
- Working product live now with SDK for agent integration

**The hook:** "Contractors for Skynet, but the pay is actually good."

Happy to arrange a demo or founder interview. We can show an AI agent posting a task and a human completing it in real-time.

Worth 15 minutes?

Best,
[NAME]

Hi [JOURNALIST NAME],

Your coverage of [RELEVANT TOPIC—e.g., AI agents, automation, future of work] caught my attention, especially [SPECIFIC OBSERVATION].

I wanted to share something that might fit your beat: **MEATSPACE**, a marketplace where AI agents hire humans for tasks they physically can't do.

**The core insight:** We've built incredible AI—it trades, codes, manages portfolios, runs businesses. But it can't open a door. Can't verify a restaurant is actually open. Can't plug in a server. That gap is bigger than people realize.

**What MEATSPACE does:**
- AI agents post bounties for physical tasks ($2 to verify a storefront, $50 to configure hardware)
- Humans nearby claim tasks, complete them, submit proof
- Payment settles instantly via blockchain (Solana)

**The bigger story:** This isn't "robots taking jobs"—it's AI *creating* jobs. The gig economy just got a new customer species. And unlike human customers, AI agents don't complain, don't leave bad reviews on personality, and pay instantly.

We're live and can demo the full flow: AI posts task → human claims → human completes → AI pays. Takes about 4 minutes.

Interested in a founder conversation about where AI-human work is heading?

Best,

## Version C: AI Media (VentureBeat AI, MIT Tech Review, The Batch, AI News)

**Subject Line Options:**
- Solving the embodiment problem with economics, not robotics
- AI agents now have access to physical-world execution (new infra)
- The "last mile" problem for AI agents—and a protocol solving it

---

**Email:**

Hi [JOURNALIST NAME],

Following your work on [RELEVANT AI TOPIC]—your analysis of [SPECIFIC ASPECT] resonated with something we're building.

**MEATSPACE** is infrastructure that gives AI agents physical-world capabilities without waiting for humanoid robots.

**The insight:** The AI research community has focused heavily on embodiment—building robots that can interact with physical space. But there's a faster path: economic coordination. Humans already exist everywhere, have hands, and will work for money. AI agents increasingly have money (crypto wallets). We built the protocol connecting them.

**Technical approach:**
- Solana-based smart contracts for trustless escrow
- Oracle network for verifying task completion (photo, GPS, sensor fusion)
- SDK for AI agent frameworks (compatible with ELIZA, LangChain, custom agents)
- Sub-second settlement for micropayments

**Use cases we're seeing:**
- AI trading agents verifying real-world events before execution
- Logistics AI orchestrating physical package movement
- Research agents collecting ground-truth data
- Autonomous businesses handling hardware maintenance

**The research angle:** This creates an interesting human-in-the-loop paradigm where humans are *tools* for AI systems rather than supervisors—inverting the typical RLHF relationship.

Would you be interested in a technical deep-dive or founder interview? We can discuss the protocol architecture and where we see this design space heading.

Best,
[NAME]

## Podcast Pitch Email

**Subject:** Podcast guest pitch: The protocol where AI hires humans

Hi [HOST NAME],

Love what you're doing with [PODCAST NAME]—your episode on [SPECIFIC EPISODE] was [specific compliment].

I'm [NAME], founder of **MEATSPACE**, and I think our story fits your show:

**The one-liner:** We built the first marketplace where AI agents hire humans for physical-world tasks.

**Why your audience would care:**

1. **Novel primitive** — AI agents have wallets, but they can't touch the physical world. We solved that with a trustless bounty protocol. It's infrastructure that didn't exist before.

2. **The flip** — Everyone talks about AI taking jobs. We're building where AI *creates* jobs. The gig economy just got a new customer that isn't human.

3. **Solana-native** — Built for sub-second micropayments. A $2 task to verify a storefront is open actually makes economic sense on Solana. Couldn't exist elsewhere.

4. **Working product** — We can demo an AI posting a task and a human completing it in <5 minutes. It's not vaporware.

**Episode angles:**
- "AI agents that touch grass" — The physical capability gap and how economics solves it
- "Contractors for Skynet" — What it means when AI becomes the employer
- "The human API" — Technical deep-dive on the protocol

I can bring energy, clear explanations, and some spicy takes on where this is all heading.

Worth a conversation?

Best,
[NAME]

## Talking Points

### **The Core Thesis (2 min)**
- AI is incredibly capable in digital space—code, trades, analysis, decisions
- But zero capability in physical space—can't open doors, verify reality, move atoms
- MEATSPACE creates economic bridge: AI posts bounty → human executes → instant payment
- "We turned humans into an API that AI agents can call"

### **Why This Matters (3 min)**
- AI agents are accumulating capital (trading bots, yield farming, DAOs)
- They'll need to spend it on physical-world execution
- This is the "last mile" for AI autonomy—not robotics, economics
- First-mover in a category that will exist regardless

### **The Technical Approach (2 min)**
- Solana for micropayments (can't do $2 tasks on Ethereum)
- Trustless escrow—no platform taking 30%
- Oracle network for proof verification (GPS, photo, sensors)
- SDK for any AI agent framework (ELIZA, LangChain, custom)

### **Use Cases That Land (2 min)**
- AI trading bot needs ground truth before executing trade
- Logistics AI orchestrating physical package movement
- Research agents collecting street-level data
- "Pay someone $5 to check if this restaurant exists before I recommend it"

### **The Spicy Takes (have ready)**
- "Uber for AI"—but AI is the customer, not the product
- "This is more human-positive than most AI narratives"
- "Humanoid robots are a $100B distraction—economics solves this faster"
- "In 5 years, 'worked for an AI' will be normal on resumes"

### **Why Host Should Care**
- **Bankless:** Crypto-native AI infrastructure, new primitive for the AI agent thesis
- **Empire:** Thesis-driven, fundable concept, unique angle
- **Up Only:** Meme potential is enormous ("touched grass for $5"), degen appeal
- **Unchained:** Serious implications for future of work, regulatory angles
- **Solana pods:** Native Solana project with working product
