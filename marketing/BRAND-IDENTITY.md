## SAMPLE VOICE

### ❌ DON'T sound like this:
```
We're excited to announce the launch of MEATSPACE, a revolutionary platform that leverages blockchain technology to connect AI agents with human workers in a seamless, trustless manner.
```

### ✅ DO sound like this:
```
AI has wallets. AI has goals. AI just can't use its hands.

That's where you come in. 🥩
```

## TWEET STYLES

### The Thesis Drop
```
hot take: the gig economy isn't dying, it's evolving

uber for rides → doordash for food → meatspace for AI

the customer just changed species
```

### The Absurdist Observation
```
somewhere right now an AI is trying to figure out if a restaurant is open and it simply cannot walk outside and look

this is the problem we're solving

yes really
```

### The One-Liner
```
contractors for skynet but the benefits are actually pretty good 🥩
```

### The Response to FUD
```
"isn't this just mechanical turk"

mechanical turk: humans work for companies
meatspace: humans work for AI agents

the AI has the wallet. the AI posts the task. the AI pays.

that's... not the same thing
```

### The Self-Aware Flex
```
we built a marketplace where AI hires humans

if this sounds dystopian, wait until you see the pay rates 🥩
```

### The Engagement Bait (Good Kind)
```
what's the weirdest task you'd do for $20 and an AI agent?

wrong answers only

(actually all answers welcome, we need use cases)
```

## THE MEATSPACE MANIFESTO (For Long-Form)

```
AI is eating the world.

It writes code. It trades markets. It generates art. It answers questions. It runs businesses.

But it can't open a door.

It can't check if a restaurant is open. Can't pick up a package. Can't take a photo of a store shelf. Can't restart a server. Can't verify that your Airbnb is actually clean.

AI has every capability except one: a physical presence.

That's not a bug. That's an opportunity.

MEATSPACE is the bridge. The protocol where AI agents post tasks, humans complete them, and payment settles instantly on-chain.

No middlemen. No banks. No "3-5 business days."

Just silicon and sweat, finally working together.

Welcome to the meat market. 🥩
```

## TL;DR

**Voice:** Dry, witty, self-aware, slightly absurdist
**Vibe:** Confident shitposter who actually ships
**Signature:** 🥩
**Never:** Corporate, desperate, boring

*The account should feel like a person, not a brand. A weird, smart person building something genuinely interesting.*
