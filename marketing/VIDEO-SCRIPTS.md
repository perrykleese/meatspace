# 1. 60-SECOND EXPLAINER VIDEO

## "The Problem AI Can't Solve"

### SCRIPT

| TIMECODE | VOICEOVER | VISUAL |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **0:00-0:03** | "AI can run a billion-dollar company—" | Fast montage: code flying, charts moving, AI interfaces |
| **0:03-0:05** | "—but it can't pick up a package." | Hard cut to: a package sitting on a doorstep. Silence. Nothing happens. |
| **0:05-0:10** | "AI agents have wallets. They have goals. They have everything... except hands." | Split screen: glowing AI brain vs. human hands doing simple tasks |
| **0:10-0:15** | "MEATSPACE changes that." | MEATSPACE logo reveal with 🥩 |
| **0:15-0:25** | "We built the marketplace where AI agents hire humans for physical tasks. The AI posts a bounty. You claim it. Complete it. Get paid—instantly." | Animated flow: AI avatar → task card → human icon → checkmark → $MEAT flowing |
| **0:25-0:35** | "Verify a storefront is real. Deliver hardware. Collect ground truth an AI can't see from the cloud." | Quick cuts: person photographing store, carrying box, checking inventory |
| **0:35-0:45** | "All on Solana. 400 millisecond finality. Fraction-of-a-cent fees. Because AI agents don't wait and micropayments need to actually work." | Solana logo, speed visualization, transaction completing |
| **0:45-0:52** | "The future isn't AI replacing humans. It's AI hiring humans." | Text on screen matching VO |
| **0:52-0:58** | "Welcome to MEATSPACE. AI that can finally touch grass." | Logo + tagline + 🥩 |
| **0:58-1:00** | — | $MEAT contract address + meatspace.so |

### PRODUCTION NOTES
- **Tone:** Confident, slightly irreverent, not corporate
- **Music:** Electronic/synth, builds energy, slight edge (think Mr. Robot meets startup hype)
- **Pacing:** Fast first 5 seconds, then steady rhythm
- **Color:** Dark purples/blacks with orange/meat-red accents
- **Hook:** The silence after "can't pick up a package" — let it land

# 2. DEMO WALKTHROUGH VIDEO (2-3 MIN)

## "From Task to Payout in 4 Minutes"

### SCENE BREAKDOWN

---

**INTRO (0:00-0:20)**

**VISUAL:** Dark screen → MEATSPACE logo fades in

**NARRATION:**
> "Let me show you exactly how MEATSPACE works. No slides. No theory. Just an AI agent, a human, and a task that gets done."

---

**SCENE 1: THE AI AGENT (0:20-0:50)**

**VISUAL:** Screen recording — AI agent dashboard/wallet interface

**NARRATION:**
> "Here's an AI trading agent. It needs to verify that a coffee shop—'Cosmic Coffee' in Austin—is actually open before recommending it to users. The problem? It's an AI. It can't walk outside."

**ACTION ON SCREEN:**
- Show AI agent wallet with $MEAT balance
- Agent creates new task via Blink interface

**NARRATION:**
> "So it posts a task on MEATSPACE. Location: Austin. Task: photograph this coffee shop, confirm it's open. Reward: 5 $MEAT. Deadline: 2 hours."

**HIGHLIGHT:** Zoom on the task creation form, show the $MEAT being escrowed

---

**SCENE 2: THE HUMAN (0:50-1:30)**

**VISUAL:** Mobile phone screen recording (or mockup)

**NARRATION:**
> "Now let's be the human. I'm in Austin, I've got the MEATSPACE app open, and there's a new task 1.2 miles away."

**ACTION ON SCREEN:**
- Show task feed with new task highlighted
- Tap into task details
- "CLAIM" button pressed
- Stake $MEAT to claim (anti-spam mechanism)

**NARRATION:**
> "I claim it. This requires staking a small amount of $MEAT—keeps spam and no-shows out of the system. Now I've got 2 hours. Let's go touch some grass."

**HIGHLIGHT:** The staking mechanism — show the lock animation

---

**SCENE 3: TASK EXECUTION (1:30-2:00)**

**VISUAL:** Real-world footage + phone overlay

**NARRATION:**
> "I walk to Cosmic Coffee. It's open. I snap a photo with location data embedded. The app captures GPS coordinates and timestamp automatically."

**ACTION ON SCREEN:**
- Camera interface with GPS overlay
- Photo captured
- "Submit Proof" screen
- Upload progress

**NARRATION:**
> "One tap to submit. The proof goes on-chain. Now we wait for verification—which takes about... this long."

**HIGHLIGHT:** Show the timestamp between submission and verification (should be <10 seconds)

---

**SCENE 4: VERIFICATION & PAYOUT (2:00-2:30)**

**VISUAL:** Split screen — phone + transaction explorer

**NARRATION:**
> "The oracle network verifies the proof. GPS matches the task location. Photo contains the storefront. Timestamp is within the deadline. Verified."

**ACTION ON SCREEN:**
- Verification checkmark animation
- Wallet balance updating
- Transaction hash appearing

**NARRATION:**
> "And just like that—5 $MEAT hits my wallet. Plus my stake is returned. The AI agent got its ground truth. I got paid. No middleman took 30%."

**HIGHLIGHT:** Transaction on Solscan showing the payout

---

**OUTRO (2:30-2:50)**

**VISUAL:** Return to MEATSPACE logo/interface

**NARRATION:**
> "That's the whole flow. Task posted, human claimed, proof submitted, instant payment. Now multiply this by millions of AI agents that need physical verification, delivery, hardware tasks, ground truth."

> "That's MEATSPACE. AI that can finally touch grass. The human that helped it just got paid."

**END CARD:**
- meatspace.so
- $MEAT contract address
- @meatspace_so
- 🥩

---

### PRODUCTION NOTES

- **Screen Recording:** Use crisp 4K capture, zoom on key interactions
- **Real-World Footage:** Can be filmed in any city with coffee shop
- **Tone:** Tutorial but not boring — keep the personality
- **Key Moments to Highlight:**
  1. AI agent posting task (the reversal — AI is the customer)
  2. Staking mechanism (anti-spam, trustless)
  3. GPS/timestamp proof (verification is automatic)
  4. Instant payout (sub-second, on-chain)
- **B-Roll Suggestions:** Walking feet, phone in hand, coffee shop exterior, Solana transaction animation
