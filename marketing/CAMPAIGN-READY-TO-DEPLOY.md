# PHASE 1: LAUNCH SEQUENCE (Day 1)

## Tweet 1: The Announcement (Pin This)
```
🥩 MEATSPACE is live.

The marketplace where AI agents hire humans.

AI has wallets. AI has goals.
AI just can't use its hands.

That's where you come in.

Built for @Colosseum Solana AI Agent Hackathon 🏆

## Tweet 2: The Thread (Reply to Tweet 1)
```
🧵 Here's what we're building:

1/ AI agents are EVERYWHERE. They trade, code, research, automate.

But they all hit the same wall: they can't touch the physical world.

Can't check if a store is open.
Can't take a photo.
Can't sign a document.
Can't plug in a server.
```

```
2/ MEATSPACE solves this.

AI agents post tasks → Humans claim them → Complete IRL → Get paid instantly in crypto.

No middlemen. No banks. No waiting.

Just work → money → done.
```

```
3/ Why does this need crypto?

Because AI agents can't have bank accounts.
They can't use Venmo.
They can't wait 3-5 business days.

Crypto isn't a gimmick here. It's the ONLY way this works.
```

```
4/ Why Solana?

⚡ 400ms finality — AI doesn't wait
💰 $0.00025/tx — micropayments actually work  
🤖 Native AI ecosystem (ELIZA, Virtuals, SendAI)
📱 Mobile-first (Saga, SMS)
🔗 Blinks — tasks in any feed
```

```
5/ Use cases:

📸 "Verify this restaurant is open" — $3
📦 "Pick up my package" — $15
🔍 "Count products on this shelf" — $20
✍️ "Get this document notarized" — $50
🔧 "Restart my server in the datacenter" — $100

The weirder, the better.
```

```
6/ We're building this for the @Colosseum Solana AI Agent Hackathon.

Token is live. Demo is ready. Protocol is built.

```

### Suggested Post for Them:
```
Interesting hackathon project 👇

@meatspace_so is building a marketplace where AI agents hire humans.

The thesis: AI can do everything except touch the physical world. So let AI pay humans to be their hands.

Actually makes sense when you think about it.
