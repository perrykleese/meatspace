### Tweet: The Engagement Bait

what's the weirdest task you'd complete for $20 if an AI agent asked?

(actually all answers welcome, we need use cases)

```

### Tweet: The Self-Aware Flex
```
we really built a protocol where AI hires humans

2024: "AI will take your job"
2026: "AI will BE your job"

the simulation is getting weird 🥩
```

### Tweet: The Technical Flex
```
why we built on solana:

- 400ms finality (AI doesn't wait)
- $0.00025/tx (micropayments work)
- blinks (tasks in your feed)
- 8.7M $MEAT in our bag

we're not leaving 🥩
```

### Tweet: The Alpha Drop
```
alpha: we're building blinks integration

imagine scrolling twitter and seeing:

"📋 TASK: Photo of nearest coffee shop menu
💰 BOUNTY: $5 in SOL
⏰ EXPIRES: 30 min
[CLAIM NOW]"

tasks... in your feed... that pay instantly

$MEAT 🥩

## MID-TIER INFLUENCER DMs (Send Tonight)

### DM to @shaborovskiy (~80K):
```
Hey — building MEATSPACE for the Solana AI Agent Hackathon. 

Quick pitch: marketplace where AI agents hire humans for physical tasks. "AI agents that can finally touch grass."

We've got the token live, demo working, full protocol built. Looking for a few respected voices to post about it.

$200 + token allocation for a post. Thoughts?

### DM to @MacroMate_ (~60K):
```
Hey — got an interesting macro thesis for you.

MEATSPACE: AI agents hire humans for physical-world tasks.

The take: AI capability is exploding but physical presence = 0. That's not a bug, it's a market. AI will pay humans to be their hands.

Token live on Solana, hackathon project. Would love your take.

$150 + tokens for a post if interested.

### DM to @CryptoCred (~100K):
```
Yo — built something weird for the Solana hackathon.

MEATSPACE ($MEAT): AI agents post tasks, humans complete them IRL, payment settles instantly on-chain.

"Gig economy but your boss is an algorithm"

Looking for a post from someone with actual reach. $200 + token allocation.

Worth 2 mins? meatspace.so
