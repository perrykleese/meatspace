# 🥩 MEATSPACE — 30-DAY CONTENT CALENDAR

> **Voice:** Dry, witty, self-aware, slightly absurdist
> **Signature:** 🥩
> **Never:** Corporate, desperate, boring

## WEEK 1: LAUNCH & THESIS ESTABLISHMENT

### DAY 1 — Launch Day

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — LAUNCH ANNOUNCEMENT [PIN THIS]**
```
🥩 MEATSPACE is live.

The marketplace where AI agents hire humans.

AI has wallets. AI has goals.
AI just can't use its hands.

That's where you come in.

meatspace.so
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — Thesis Drop**
```
hot take: the gig economy isn't dying, it's evolving

uber for rides → doordash for food → meatspace for AI

the customer just changed species 🥩
```

**Tweet 3 (Evening) — Engagement Question**
```
what's the weirdest task you'd do for $20 and an AI agent?

wrong answers only

(actually all answers welcome, we need use cases) 🥩
```

---

### DAY 2 — The Problem

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — Capability Gap**
```
AI can:
- trade millions in milliseconds
- write code in 40 languages
- analyze every research paper ever written
- beat grandmasters at chess

AI cannot:
- check if a door is locked

we fixed the second part 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — Absurdist Observation**
```
somewhere right now an AI is trying to figure out if a restaurant is open

it has access to the entire internet

it still can't just... walk outside and look

this is the problem we're solving

yes really 🥩
```

---

### DAY 3 — Why Crypto

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — Thesis Drop**
```
"why does this need crypto"

because AI agents can't:
- have bank accounts
- use venmo
- wait 3-5 business days
- sign up for paypal with a social security number

crypto isn't a gimmick here. it's the only infrastructure that works. 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — One-Liner**
```
every AI payment rail pitch: "what if AI had bank accounts"

meatspace: "what if AI just had wallets"

one of these works today 🥩
```

**Tweet 3 (Evening) — Engagement**
```
serious question: how would you pay an AI agent?

- bank wire (lol)
- paypal (needs SSN)
- crypto (works)
- ???

if you have a fourth option I'm listening 🥩
```

---

### DAY 4 — Why Solana

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — Feature Drop**
```
why solana for AI agents:

⚡ 400ms finality — agents don't wait
💰 $0.00025/tx — micropayments work
🔗 blinks — tasks in any feed
📱 mobile-first infra

if AI is going to hire humans for $3 tasks, the fees can't be $50

basic math 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — Comparison**
```
AI agent on ethereum: "I need someone to verify this address exists"

*$47 gas fee*

AI agent: "actually nevermind I'll just assume"

this is why we built on solana 🥩
```

---

### DAY 5 — Use Cases

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — Use Case Spotlight**
```
use case #1: the mystery shopper agent

AI runs 50 e-commerce brands
needs real photos of competitor stores
can't walk into a mall

posts task: "$15 — photograph nike store window display at [location]"

human does it in 10 minutes
gets paid instantly

everyone wins 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — List Format**
```
tasks AI agents will pay you for:

📸 "verify this business is open" — $3
📦 "pick up my package" — $15
🔍 "count items on shelf" — $20
✍️ "notarize this document" — $50
🔧 "restart server in datacenter" — $100

the weirder, the better 🥩
```

**Tweet 3 (Evening) — Engagement**
```
what's a physical task you'd pay $10 to never do again?

now imagine an AI agent feels the same way about EVERY physical task

that's the market 🥩
```

---

### DAY 6 — Community Building

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — CTA**
```
building the human API for AI agents

looking for:
🤖 AI builders who need physical capabilities
🙋 humans who want to earn doing micro-tasks
🎨 degens who appreciate absurdist humor

meatspace.so

$MEAT 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — Self-Aware Flex**
```
we built a marketplace where AI hires humans

if this sounds dystopian, wait until you see the pay rates 🥩
```

---

### DAY 7 — Weekly Recap Thread

**Tweet 1 (Thread)**
```
week 1 recap 🧵

launched meatspace — the marketplace where AI agents hire humans

here's what happened:
```

**Reply 1:**
```
1/ the problem is simple:

AI has every capability except physical presence

can't check if a store is open
can't pick up a package
can't restart a server

billions in AI capital, zero hands
```

**Reply 2:**
```
2/ the solution:

AI posts task + escrow
human claims
human completes
human gets paid

all on-chain. all instant. no middlemen.
```

**Reply 3:**
```
3/ why crypto matters:

AI can't have bank accounts
AI can't wait for ACH
AI can't use paypal

crypto is the only payment rail that works for autonomous agents
```

**Reply 4:**
```
4/ week 1 stats:

[insert actual stats]

the thesis is validating 🥩
```

---

## WEEK 2: DEEPER THESIS & ENGAGEMENT

### DAY 8 — The Future of Work

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — Thesis Drop**
```
hot take:

"AI will take all the jobs" — wrong

"AI will create new jobs" — closer

"AI will become the customer" — correct

the biggest employer of the future might not be a company

it might be a swarm of autonomous agents 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — Observation**
```
the history of work:

1800s: work for a person
1900s: work for a company
2000s: work for a platform
2020s: work for an algorithm

2025+: work for an AI

we're just making it explicit 🥩
```

---

### DAY 9 — Meme Day

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — Meme**
```
POV: you're a contractor for skynet but the benefits are actually pretty good 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — Self-Deprecating**
```
startup idea: AI hires humans

VC: isn't that just... a job?

me: yes but the boss is a language model and you get paid in crypto

VC: ...

me: we called it meatspace

VC: I'm in 🥩
```

**Tweet 3 (Evening) — Engagement**
```
fill in the blank:

"I would [___] for an AI agent if it paid me $50"

most unhinged answer wins my respect 🥩
```

---

### DAY 10 — Technical Credibility

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — Architecture**
```
how meatspace works:

1. AI agent calls our API
2. task + payment escrowed in smart contract
3. human claims via app
4. human completes + submits proof
5. verifier confirms
6. payment releases automatically

no trust required. just code. 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — Developer Focus**
```
for AI agent builders:

POST /tasks
{
  "description": "photograph store at 123 main st",
  "payment": 500000, // lamports
  "deadline": "2h",
  "location": { "lat": 40.7, "lng": -74.0 }
}

that's it. your agent can now hire humans.

docs at meatspace.so/docs 🥩
```

---

### DAY 11 — FUD Response Day

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — Mechanical Turk Comparison**
```
"isn't this just mechanical turk"

mechanical turk: humans work for companies
meatspace: humans work for AI agents

the AI has the wallet. the AI posts the task. the AI pays.

companies are middlemen. we removed them. 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — Dystopia Response**
```
"this is dystopian"

counterpoint: getting paid instantly for micro-tasks with no boss, no interview, no commute, no corporate politics

vs

working for a human manager who ghosts your PTO requests

which is dystopian again? 🥩
```

**Tweet 3 (Evening) — Why Token Response**
```
"why does this need a token"

1. governance — humans and AI need aligned incentives
2. staking — reputation requires skin in game
3. payment rail — AI agents hold $MEAT, pay in $MEAT
4. coordination — bootstrapping two-sided marketplace

not every project needs a token. this one does. 🥩
```

---

### DAY 12 — Use Case Deep Dive

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — Thread: Verification Agent**
```
use case deep dive: the verification agent 🧵

AI insurance company needs to verify claims
"did this car actually get damaged?"
"is this business actually at this address?"

can't send an adjuster for every $200 claim
```

**Reply 1:**
```
solution:

AI posts task: "photograph vehicle at [address], damage to front bumper, $15"

human nearby claims task
drives over
takes photos
submits

AI verifies photos match claim
payment releases
claim processes
```

**Reply 2:**
```
economics:

traditional adjuster visit: $150+
meatspace verification: $15

AI processes 10x more claims
humans earn doing simple tasks
fraud decreases (can't fake on-demand photos)

everyone wins 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — One-Liner**
```
AI has trust issues

fair tbh

that's why every task requires proof 🥩
```

---

### DAY 13 — Ecosystem Play

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — AI Agent Ecosystem**
```
the AI agent stack:

@virtikitten — entertainment & characters
@sendaifun — communication
@ai16zdao — investment & trading
@meatspace_so — physical world execution

AI agents are building an economy

we're the hands 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — Integration Pitch**
```
if your AI agent has ever needed to:

- verify something exists IRL
- deliver something physical
- get eyes on a location
- perform any real-world action

DM us

we're building integrations 🥩
```

---

### DAY 14 — Weekly Recap

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — Reflection**
```
week 2 learnings:

- people actually want to do weird tasks for AI
- "touch grass" resonates way more than expected
- the dystopia jokes write themselves
- solana ai ecosystem is cracked

on to week 3 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — Engagement**
```
what should we build next?

🔁 RT = mobile app for task workers
❤️ like = telegram bot for agents
💬 reply = something else

building in public 🥩
```

---

## WEEK 3: GROWTH & COMMUNITY

### DAY 15 — Milestone Celebration

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — Milestone**
```
[X] tasks completed on meatspace

AI agents are hiring humans

this isn't a concept anymore

it's happening 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — Community Shoutout**
```
shoutout to everyone building with meatspace:

[tag early adopters/builders]

the first believers always matter most 🥩
```

---

### DAY 16 — Partner/Ecosystem

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — Solana Love**
```
hot take: solana isn't just a fast chain

it's the only chain where AI-to-human micropayments actually make sense

$0.00025 per task posting
400ms to confirm
mobile-first infra

ethereum maxis won't get it and that's okay 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — Blinks Feature**
```
what if you could claim a task... from a tweet?

solana blinks make it possible

AI posts task → embedded in any feed → human claims without leaving twitter

the UX just keeps getting better 🥩
```

---

### DAY 17 — Human Stories

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — Human Focus**
```
let's talk about the humans

meatspace isn't just "AI hires humans"

it's:
- student earning between classes
- retiree with free time
- local expert monetizing knowledge
- anyone with a phone and spare minutes

flexible work that actually works 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — Testimonial Template**
```
"I made $[X] this week doing [task type]"

— someone, probably soon

DM us your meatspace stories 🥩
```

---

### DAY 18 — Education Day

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — Explainer Thread**
```
"I still don't get it" — fair

let me explain meatspace like you're 5 🧵

robot has money
robot needs help with something in real life
robot can't do it (no body)
you do it
robot pays you
everyone happy

that's it. that's the whole thing. 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — Analogy**
```
think of meatspace like uber

except the passenger is an AI
and the ride is "go take a photo of this building"
and payment is instant crypto

okay maybe it's not that much like uber

but you get it 🥩
```

---

### DAY 19 — Absurdist Content Day

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — Philosophical**
```
in 1950: "will machines ever think?"

in 2024: "can your thinking machine hire someone to check if the pizza place is still open"

we've come so far 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — Observation**
```
AI in movies: takes over the world, enslaves humanity

AI in reality: "can someone please go see if that store has oat milk in stock, I will pay you $3"

the future is weirder than fiction 🥩
```

**Tweet 3 (Evening) — One-Liner**
```
terminators don't need meatspace

but your friendly neighborhood language model sure does 🥩
```

human claims
completes IRL
payment settles on solana

all in under 3 minutes

recording the video today 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — BTS**
```
behind the scenes: spent 2 hours trying to film a demo

turns out making "AI hires human" look exciting on video is... challenging

the future is mundane and that's actually the point 🥩
```

---

### DAY 24 — Legitimacy Building

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — Why This Matters**
```
let's talk about why meatspace matters 🧵

AI agents are getting autonomous
they have wallets
they make decisions
they can transact

but they hit a wall: the physical world

until now.
```

**Reply 1:**
```
this isn't just a hackathon project

it's infrastructure for a future where:
- AI agents are economic actors
- physical tasks have instant liquidity
- humans earn flexibly without employers

the gig economy, evolved 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — Credibility**
```
"are you serious about this?"

- smart contracts: deployed
- API: live
- demo: working
- token: trading
- docs: written
- team: building

yes. we're serious. 🥩
```

---

### DAY 25 — Expansion Vision

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — Future Roadmap**
```
where meatspace goes from here:

phase 1: simple verification tasks ✅
phase 2: complex multi-step operations
phase 3: AI agent swarms coordinating human teams
phase 4: ???

we're building the coordination layer between silicon and carbon 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — Bold Claim**
```
prediction:

in 5 years, "AI hired me to do this" will be as normal as "uber paid me for this ride"

we're just early 🥩
```

---

### DAY 26 — Community Celebration

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — Thank You**
```
to everyone who's believed in meatspace:

- the early task completers
- the AI agent builders who integrated
- the degens who bought $MEAT
- the shitposters who spread the word

we see you. we appreciate you. 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — Challenge**
```
challenge: explain meatspace to someone who doesn't follow crypto twitter

difficulty: hard

if you can do it in one sentence, reply below 🥩
```

---

### DAY 27 — Technical Thread

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — Deep Dive Thread**
```
how meatspace escrow actually works 🧵

1. AI agent calls POST /tasks with payment amount
2. smart contract creates escrow PDA
3. funds locked until task completion OR deadline

no trust required. just math.
```

**Reply 1:**
```
verification layer:

- photo tasks: GPS metadata + timestamp + AI image verification
- delivery tasks: recipient confirmation
- complex tasks: multi-sig dispute resolution

we assume everyone lies. the protocol doesn't care. 🥩
```

**Reply 2:**
```
dispute handling:

if human disputes → evidence submitted → third-party verifier rules → automated payout

no customer service. no "let me talk to your manager."

just code. 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — Builder Flex**
```
the code is the documentation

anchor programs: github.com/meatspace-so
SDK: npm install @meatspace/sdk
API: meatspace.so/docs

forkable. auditable. improvable.

we build in public 🥩
```

---

### DAY 28 — Narrative Push

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — Thesis Restatement**
```
the meatspace thesis, one more time:

AI agents are becoming economic actors
they need physical-world capabilities
humans have those capabilities
crypto enables instant, trustless payment

marketplace connects supply and demand

that's it. that's the whole bet. 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — Call to Action**
```
still here?

- want to earn crypto doing tasks? → meatspace.so
- building AI agents? → meatspace.so/docs
- just want to watch? → follow along

we're building the future of work

might as well come along 🥩
```

---

### DAY 29 — Hackathon Submission

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — Submission Announcement**
```
🏆 submitted to @colosseum solana AI agent hackathon

MEATSPACE — AI agents that can finally touch grass

- problem: AI can't do physical tasks
- solution: marketplace connecting AI agents to humans
- why crypto: only payment rail that works for AI

meatspace.so

let's see what happens 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — Gratitude**
```
building in public during a hackathon is a trip

every day: ship, tweet, ship, tweet

thanks to everyone who engaged, questioned, supported

win or lose, meatspace is just getting started 🥩
```

---

### DAY 30 — Looking Forward

**Tweet 1 (Morning) — Month Recap**
```
30 days of meatspace:

- concept → reality
- [x] tasks completed
- [x] humans paid
- [x] AI agents served
- 1 hackathon submitted
- ∞ "touch grass" jokes made

month 1: done
month 2: loading... 🥩
```

**Tweet 2 (Afternoon) — Future Tease**
```
what's next for meatspace?

📱 mobile app (coming soon)
🤝 more agent integrations
🌍 geographic expansion
🔧 complex task types
🤖 agent-to-agent coordination

this is infrastructure for a new economy

we're just getting started 🥩
```

**Tweet 3 (Evening) — Community**
```
final thought:

the best part of building meatspace isn't the tech

it's watching people get genuinely excited about AI hiring humans

the future is weird and you're all here for it

see you in month 2 🥩
```

---

## REPLY TEMPLATES

### For "What is this?"
```
AI agents are everywhere — trading, coding, automating.

but they can't touch the physical world.

meatspace lets AI agents hire humans for real-world tasks.

AI posts task → human completes → instant crypto payment.

that's it. 🥩
```

### For "Why crypto/blockchain?"
```
because AI agents can't:
- have bank accounts
- use venmo
- wait 3-5 business days

crypto isn't a gimmick here. it's the only payment infrastructure that works for autonomous agents. 🥩
```

### For "Isn't this just Mechanical Turk?"
```
mechanical turk: humans work for companies
meatspace: humans work for AI agents directly

the AI has the wallet. the AI posts the task. the AI pays.

no middleman company. that's the difference. 🥩
```

### For "This is dystopian"
```
is it?

- work when you want
- no boss
- no interview
- no commute
- instant payment
- choose your tasks

vs traditional employment

which one sounds dystopian again? 🥩
```

### For "Why do you need a token?"
```
1. AI agents need a native payment rail
2. reputation staking requires skin in game
3. governance — humans and AI need aligned incentives
4. bootstrapping two-sided marketplace

we didn't want a token. we needed one. 🥩
```

### For "Is this real?"
```
- smart contracts: deployed ✅
- API: live ✅
- demo: working ✅
- token: trading ✅
- tasks: being completed ✅

that's it. 🥩
```

### For "What tasks can I post?"
```
anything physical:
- verify a location exists
- photograph something
- deliver an item
- check if a business is open
- collect physical data
- notarize documents

if it needs a human body, we can do it. 🥩
```

### For price/token questions
```
we don't do price talk

we build things

if you're here for the tech, welcome
if you're here for number go up, that's fine too

but we're focused on building 🥩
```

### For partnership inquiries
```
DM open for:
- AI agent integrations
