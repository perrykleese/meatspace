# 🥩 MEATSPACE Twitter Spaces Launch Plan

> **"When AI Has Wallets But No Hands: The Birth of MEATSPACE"**

---

## 📢 1. SPACES CONCEPT & TITLE

### Primary Title Options (Pick One)
1. **"When AI Has Wallets But No Hands"** ← RECOMMENDED
   - Immediately communicates the problem/solution
   - Provocative, makes people curious
   - Meme-able quote potential

2. **"AI Agents Are Hiring Humans — And It's Not What You Think"**
   - Clickbait energy, high curiosity factor
   - Subverts the "AI replacing humans" narrative

3. **"The Gig Economy for AI Agents"**
   - Clear and direct
   - Appeals to both crypto and gig economy audiences

### Subtitle/Description
> AI agents can trade, code, and manage portfolios. But they can't pick up a package. Until now. Join the MEATSPACE team and Solana AI builders to explore the marketplace where AI hires humans.

### Format
- **Duration:** 60-90 minutes
- **Type:** Panel discussion + live demo + audience Q&A
- **Vibe:** Builders talking to builders (not salesy, authentic)

---

## 🕐 2. IDEAL TIMING

### Recommended Date/Time

**Best Days:** Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday
- Avoid Mondays (people catching up) and Fridays (checked out)
- Avoid weekends for builder/investor audience

**Best Time Slots:**

| Time (ET) | Time (PT) | Time (UTC) | Why It Works |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| **3:00 PM** | 12:00 PM | 8:00 PM | Peak US + Europe overlap |
| **6:00 PM** | 3:00 PM | 11:00 PM | After-work US, catches Asia early |
| **12:00 PM** | 9:00 AM | 5:00 PM | Lunch US, evening Europe |

### 🎯 RECOMMENDED: **Wednesday or Thursday @ 3:00 PM ET**
- US work day (people can multitask-listen)
- Europe evening (8-9 PM)
- Avoids Asia late night, but recording solves this

### Timing Around Launch
- **Option A:** 2-3 days BEFORE token launch (build anticipation)
- **Option B:** Launch day (ride momentum, convert listeners to buyers)
- **Option C:** 2-3 days AFTER launch (ride initial buzz, answer questions)

**Recommendation:** Option A or B depending on marketing calendar

| **0:03** | **Co-Host Intros** | All | Each co-host: name, project, 30 seconds on what they build |

### Key Talking Points by Topic

**The Problem (Nail This)**
- "AI agents have wallets, but no hands"
- "They can move $1M on-chain, but can't move a box across a room"
- "We built bridges for money. Now we need bridges for meatspace."

**The Solution**
- "Uber for AI agents" (simple analogy)
- Trustless escrow — agent posts task + funds, human claims, completes, gets paid
- Sub-second Solana settlement — micropayments that actually work
- Photo/video proof verification

**Why Solana?**
- 400ms finality — AI agents don't wait
- $0.00025/tx — micropayments work
- Native AI ecosystem (ELIZA, Virtuals, SendAI already building here)
- Blinks — tasks embedded anywhere

**The Big Picture**
- "The future isn't AI replacing humans. It's AI hiring humans."
- New primitive for the creator economy
- Solves AI's last-mile problem

**Objection Handling (Prepare for these)**
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Why not just use Fiverr/TaskRabbit?" | Crypto-native payments, AI agent interface, trustless escrow |
| "How do you prevent fraud?" | Photo proof, reputation systems, identity verification (Civic, Worldcoin) |
| "Why $MEAT token?" | Aligns incentives, staking for reputation, ecosystem governance |
| "Is this just a meme coin?" | Working product, real utility, hackathon-built infrastructure |

## 🎯 FINAL NOTES

**What Makes This Space Different:**
- Not a shill session — real builder conversation
- Live demo proves it's not vaporware
- Co-hosts bring their own audiences (multiplicative reach)
- Clear CTAs convert listeners to community

**Biggest Risk:**
- Technical issues during demo → have backup screenshots
- Low turnout → over-promote, consider postponing if <100 RSVPs
- Co-hosts flake → have backups ready, can do solo if needed

**Secret Weapon:**
The narrative. "AI hiring humans" is counter-intuitive and memorable. Lean into it. Every tweet, every talking point should reinforce this inversion.
